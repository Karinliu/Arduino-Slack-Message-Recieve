# Introduction
Before we start coding and building this prototype, I will first explain what this prototype does and how it works. 

First of all, this prototype is builded in `Arduino` and a LEDstrip. Other programs that also have been used for this are:`Adafruit`, `Zapier` and `Slack` (later this will be further explained). 

### "BUT WHAT DOES THIS PIECE OF CODE DO?!"

Well, what this code exactly does is when you recieve a message on Slack in the chatroom `general`, you will recieve a notification. The notification is displayed in the LED strip that is connected to your arduino.

# Alright, so how do I start?
First of all you need to create an account on Zapier (https://zapier.com/) and Adafruit (https://io.adafruit.com/). After you made an account we can start with building.

## Adafruit
When your account is created, are there a few steps to do:
  1. Click on `View AIO Key` and copy the Username and Active Key on a place where you can easily find it (you will need it for later).
  2. Go to `Dashboards`



## Zapier
When everything is filled in on Adafruit, we can start with Zapier. After your Zapier account is created, we can start by clicking on `Make a Zap`

After that, there are a few input fields we need to fill in.
